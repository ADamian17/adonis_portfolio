export const ABOUT_ME = `Hola! I’m Adonis Martin, a classically trained Ballet and Modern dancer turned full-stack
    engineer born and raised in Contramaestre, Cuba. Although I’ve taken my last bow, I danced
    professionally for 11 years. That training is the foundation of my career, and the same
    skills that helped me succeed on stage are the ones that lead me to my second act as a
    developer. I love collaborating with a team, thinking of innovative ways to strategize and
    bring something to life. I love learning and exploring, tackling challenges both physical
    and mental. At my core, I’m a creator, infusing my passion and energy into every project.
    My culture is important to me -- while this means I’m bilingual (proficient in English and
    Spanish), it also means that dance and music are in my blood. You can usually find me
    grooving to Bad bunny(reggaeton artists) while I’m working, and my creative background
    brings a fresh perspective. I’d love to connect with people and companies building great
    things. Feel free to reach out at adonisdesuvikdo@gmail.com or (510)-987-6466.`,
